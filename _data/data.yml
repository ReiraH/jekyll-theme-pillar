      Role description: During my traineeship, I participated in establishing both functional and
      technical rules for data retention. Furthermore, I focused significantly on understanding data
      models within the organization and what the business needs regarding data. I frequently
      communicated with various stakeholders, from management to operational teams, to align a
      unified process. Additionally, I facilitated communication between the stakeholders. I assisted
      in discussing the process and in drafting and reviewing guidelines, as well as potentially writing
      VBScript in Power Designer, which was necessary for my team and new employees who will
      conduct GAP analyses in the future. The Scaled Agile methodology is becoming increasingly
      important in the organization. I also obtained my Scaled Agile certification.
